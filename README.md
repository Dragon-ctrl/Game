It is designed with a responsive approach to ensure that the website looks good and is easy to use on any device, regardless of screen size or resolution. It utilizes the Material Design system developed by Google that emphasizes the use of flat, two-dimensional elements and vibrant, bold colors. Animations have been added to add motion and dynamism to the website to draw attention to elements, guide users through a process, and add visual interest.
